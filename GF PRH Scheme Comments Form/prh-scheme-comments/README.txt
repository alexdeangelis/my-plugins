This plugin replaces the comments.php file used in the theme in order to rename the comment form title & fields. It also stops the IP address being stored.

== Description ==

This plugin is specifically designed to replace the commments.php file that the Beaver Builder Theme uses on the PRH The Scheme website. 

The plugin changes the h2 title of the comments form, and the labels of the comment box, name field & email field. It also erases the IP address of the commenter on submission so that no IP address is stored on the system.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `prh-scheme-comments.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If not already done, please install & activate Advanced Custom Fields
